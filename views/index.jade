        p.text-white What is SuperCaly?
        | SuperCaly, derived from "Super Calendar", is a mobile-based calendar application designed for both android and IOS environments.
        | While the key idea of SuperCaly is derived from a traditional Calendar application, it is much more powerful. In addition to the functionality of
        | creating events and sending invites, SuperCaly extends this basic functionality of
        | a calendar app and provides features like:
        br
        | ● Organised Event View
        br
        | ● Auto-location event generation
        br
        | ● Map-View of the calendar events
        br
        | ● Auto-sync of google events
        br
        | ● Convenient content search
        br
        | ● Functionality to chat
        br
        br
        p.text-white Our Goal
        p The primary thought behind the creation of SuperCaly was to create an application that will help people organise life better, by providing them with all means and information needs.
